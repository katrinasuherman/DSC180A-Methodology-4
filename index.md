## Quarter 2 brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I believe that the most interesting topic is learning and discovering about the neuromaps library that helps simplify the process of comparing brain maps. It is a library that lets us compare cortical brain maps across different coordinate systems and resolutions. In addition, it includes built in transforms plus convenient plotting utilities to visualize brain maps quickly.


**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I'm really interested in building a supervised study that predicts clinical diagnosis from cortical brain maps or any other type of brain maps. I will utilize the neuromaps library to align all subjects to one surface space, extract regional features, and train a simple baseline first, then compare to stronger models.


**What is a potential change you would make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I used the HCP S1200 cortical-thickness map early in the pipeline during the first quarter. The next time, I would begin with a more comprehensive dataset survey, looking at several possible maps like myelin, curvature, or functional gradients to determine which show more distinct spatial patterns. Before committing to a single source, I would additionally perform surface previews, fast correlation matrices, and histogram checks.


**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I would be interested to examine ensemble methods and other predictive modeling techniques. I want to expand the investigation by using machine learning models that can predict clinical or cognitive qualities from cortical features after reproducing the spin test framework. These models could show which cortical regions or feature sets contribute more to the predictions and enable testing if integrating several structural or functional brain maps increases prediction accuracy.
