## Quarter 2 brainstorming

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
Discovering neuromaps. It is a library that lets us compare cortical brain maps across different coordinate systems and resolutions, and it includes built in transforms plus convenient plotting utilities to visualize brain maps quickly.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
Build a supervised study that predicts clinical diagnosis from cortical brain maps or any other type of brain maps. Use the neuromaps library to align all subjects to one surface space, extract regional features, and train a simple baseline first, then compare to stronger models.

**What is a potential change you would make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
